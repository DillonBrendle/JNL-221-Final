    <p>Syracuse N.Y. — Saving for retirement can be a daunting task that’s easier to push off than face head on. Many Americans are making exactly that decision. Only 58.6% of Americans have any retirement savings according to a 2019 survey by the Federal Reserve, but the consequences of waiting can be significant.</p>

    <p>“You’re missing out on the compound interest on these savings,” Professor Ravi Shukla, the Finance Department Chair at the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University said. “The earlier you start saving the more time you have for your money to earn interest upon interest. That is the big factor.”</p>

    <p>Many tools exist to show what you should put away and why you should start early. Some of the easiest include these tools from <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/retirement-income-calculator" target="_blank">Vanguard</a> and <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator" target="_blank">NerdWallet</a>.</p>

    <p>The number of families in the United States without any savings is concerning to Professor Shukla.</p>

    <p>“It worries me a lot,” Shukla said. “It is imperative that we must save and plan for our future because if we don’t, either we will become a burden on our family or we will become a burden on the government.”</p>

    <p>Shukla teaches a course on financial modeling. One of the key models he works on with his students is on retirement savings. Shukla hopes the activity will create a spark for students to realize the importance of saving and how time can be the most valuable asset.</p>

    <p>“If you make the right choices you’ll be able to save some of the money and that will do wonders in the long run,” Shukla said. “I know that some people will say they don’t have enough earnings to save money and so on, I understand that, but I also see students comfortable walking into Starbucks and paying five bucks for a cup of coffee.”</p>

    <p>The Federal Reserve conducts a survey every three years to gauge how many American families are saving and how much. A look into the data shows the type of people most likely to be ahead on their retirement savings.</p> 

    <p>In 2019 Homeowner’s scored 20% higher in percentage of families with savings than those who were renting.</p>

        </script>

    <p>“[Homeowners] start thinking about equity,” Shukla said. “They see the money they are paying for their mortgage to pay for the house building up their equity.”</p>

    <p>Shukla says the most plausible explanation for the difference in saving is behavioral.</p>

    <p>“That idea of equity makes them a bit more aware of these things and also more responsible,” Shukla said. “The people who are homeowners are more careful about their money, they are thinking long term.”</p>

    <p>Education was another characteristic where clear differences existed between different groups. The percentage of Americans with college degrees and retirement savings was more than 24% greater than the percentage of households without a high school diploma that had savings.</p>

<iframe title="Percentage of Families Saving for Retirement by Education Level" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-2LKP3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2LKP3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="450" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

    <p>Professor Shukla was not surprised to see college attendees and graduates saving more often than those who never attended a university. What was surprising was the recovery of each of these groups after the 2008 recession. It’s clear from the graph that the housing crisis of 2008 meant fewer households were putting money away. But more than a decade later the most educated people were not recovering as quickly as those that did not graduate high school. The answer for Shukla lies in who the 2008 recession impacted most.</p> 

    <p>“The financial crisis of 2008 was a crisis because of real estate and banking which affects white collar workers much more,” Shukla said.</p>

    <p>Race also played a pivotal role in predicting how many families were saving for retirement.</p> 

<iframe title="Percentage of Families Saving for Retirement by Race" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-GWHcu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GWHcu/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="205" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

    <p>A warning Shukla shared on race and ethnicity data was that it may be confounded by other factors.</p> 

    <p>“We know the minority community have generally lower levels of education,” Shukla said. “You might be saying the same thing based on what you said about education.”</p>

    <p>Additionally, the survey may not fairly capture all communities the same way.</p>

    <p>“There might be more unorganized forms of savings in these communities. They might not show up in bank deposits. There might be more intergenerational transfers which we don’t see as savings,” Shukla said. “I'm especially thinking of the hispanic community where the grandmother basically supports the education of the grandchild and the implicit understanding is that that will get repaid in the future.”</p>

    <p>In addition to education, different inequalities in pay can easily explain why minority households are less likely to be saving for retirement.</p> 

    <p>Shukla understands the hurdles to saving for young people but urges people with the luxury of time to reconsider their choices.</p>

    <p>“I think it's making those choices of ‘how much is this immediate gratification worth?’ It’s very difficult for young people to think 40 years down the road, it seems like an eternity,” Shukla said. “What I’ve convinced myself is it is better for me to save, that is, find a way to cut spending than to try and make more money. Young college students have to understand that you’re spending money and [you] can make it up by earning more this week or next week or in the future but [you] have to realize the fact you’ll be paying taxes…that means many more hours than you think that you have to work.”</p> 

    <p>Shukla’s advice to students is to start with something because even small amounts add up.</p>

    <p>“I tell everyone I can to open a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp" target="_blank">Roth IRA</a> right now. Put what earnings in that you can. It will be so useful to you when you graduate,” Shukla said.</p>

    <p>The positive for Shukla and those that encourage early savings is that the Federal Reserve’s data shows improvement in savings percentage for Americans under the age of 35. In 2001 about 53% of Americans under 35 were saving but in 2019 that number was up to more than 60%.</p>
